Project Python Foundations: FoodHub Data Analysis

Situation:
 FoodHub, a New York-based food delivery aggregator, needed insights from their customer order data to improve delivery performance, restaurant partnerships, and customer satisfaction.
Task:
 Was assigned to perform comprehensive data analysis on customer orders to extract insights about delivery trends, top restaurants, revenue estimates, and to identify strategies for improved customer experience and operational efficiency.

ðŸ”§ Action:
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Loaded the dataset and examined data types and structure.


Handled missing values using appropriate imputation strategies.


Created new columns (e.g., total delivery time) for deeper analysis.


2. Univariate Analysis
Analyzed distributions of key variables like delivery time, order cost, ratings.


Identified outliers and trends using histograms and box plots.


Ranked top restaurants and identified popular cuisines during weekends.


3. Multivariate Analysis
Explored relationships between delivery time, ratings, and order value.


Filtered and profiled customers based on frequency to identify loyal customers.


Compared preparation times and delays between restaurants.


4. Revenue & Business Logic Implementation
Calculated revenue using two business models (25% and 15% commission margins).


Identified eligible restaurants for promotional campaigns (e.g., those with rating > 4.5).


Segmented high-value customers and flagged slow deliveries (> 60 min).


5. Strategic Recommendations
Suggested discount strategies for the top 3 loyal customers.


Recommended focusing on reliable restaurants with faster prep times.


Proposed operational improvements based on weekend delivery delays.



âœ… Result:
1. Operational Insights
Found that 26% of orders exceeded 60-minute delivery time â€” helped flag operational inefficiencies.


Identified weekends as peak for popular cuisines â€” suggested shifting resources accordingly.


2. Customer Retention Opportunities
Isolated top 3 loyal customers and proposed discounts to retain them.


Identified restaurants suitable for campaigns based on performance metrics.


3. Revenue Estimation
Estimated net revenue based on 25% and 15% commission rules â€” helped align marketing and operations to revenue targets.


4. Business Impact
Delivered actionable insights that helped the team prioritize efficient restaurants, refine promotional strategies, and improve customer satisfaction through targeted recommendations.
